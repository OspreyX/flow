.. rubric:: Financial portfolio analysis library

The jFlow project is aimed at providing a pluggable software framework for quantitative finance. 
It is an opensource library distributed under the very liberal BSD licence.

jFlow is written in Python and comes with a battery included django_ site for testing, visualising data and so forth.

Finance is an area where well-written open-source projects could make a tremendous
difference and jflow aim is to achieve that status.
